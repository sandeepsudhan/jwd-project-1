# Author
I'm Sandeep S. I created this webpage for submission to the Web-Development course in [Opportunity College](https://www.opcollege.org/). At the time of creating this project, I'm enrolled into the ['Web Development - Part Time Program'](https://www.opcollege.org/web-development). I used a Macbook-Air-2022 to begin this project and my primary IDE is ['Visual Studio Code'](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
